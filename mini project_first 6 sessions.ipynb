    "### **Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this task is to analyze two types of brain imaging data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structural MRI data**, to assess changes in hippocampal volume over time.\n",
    "2. **Functional MRI (fMRI) data**, to examine the time-series signal at a specific voxel in the brain.\n",

    "* **Follow-up:** two years later\n",
    "\n",
    "Each scan provides the hippocampal volume for that patient.\n",

    "   `Patient_ID`, `Baseline_Volume`, `Followup_Volume`, `Percent_Change`, `Category`\n",
